# Fix Code Quality Issues

This PR addresses several code quality issues throughout the codebase:

## Fixes

### Duplicate Declarations
- Removed duplicate declaration of  from OpenAIService.swift
- Consolidated  into a shared model file to avoid duplications

### Incorrect Argument Labels
- Fixed parameter name mismatch in  (was using  but method expected )

### Deprecated APIs
- Updated deprecated  usage with iOS 15+ compatibility
- Added fallbacks for older iOS versions

### Error Handling
- Added proper error handling for all throwing methods
- Implemented consistent try/catch blocks where needed
- Fixed file operations to properly handle potential errors

### Method Consistency
- Created proper throwing and non-throwing method pairs
- Marked non-throwing convenience methods as deprecated
- Updated method implementations to use their throwing counterparts

### Other Improvements
- Fixed error handling in LibraryViewController for file operations and deletion
- Enhanced error reporting with descriptive messages

## Testing
All functionality has been preserved while improving error handling and code quality.
